//console is a built-in object in JavaScript.
//It provides access to the browserâ€™s debugging console (or terminal, if you're using Node.js).
//It has several methods, such as log(), warn(), error(), etc., that help you display output or messages.
//.log is a method (a function inside an object) of the console object, It is used to print/output text or variables to the console.

// ; (semicolon) It is optional in most cases because JavaScript automatically inserts them where needed. But using it is a good habit for clean, predictable code.

console.log("Hello, World! (Double Quotes)");
